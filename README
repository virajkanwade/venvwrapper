venvwrapper
#################

venvwrapper is a set of extensions to Python 3 venv module. The extensions include
wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise
managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more
than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their
dependencies.

This is a direct port of Doug Hellmann's virtualenvwrapper
